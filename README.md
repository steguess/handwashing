🌟👐 Explore the life-saving impact of handwashing, inspired by the pioneering work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847! 💧🏥

# Handwashing Saves Lives 🌟👐

Welcome to the Handwashing Saves Lives project! In this historical analysis, we explore the groundbreaking discovery made by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847: handwashing. Dr. Semmelweis's realization that contaminated hands were a major cause of childbed fever led to the implementation of handwashing protocols in his hospital, saving hundreds of lives.

## Project Tasks 📝

1. **Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis**: Introduction to the pioneering physician and his era.
2. **The Alarming Number of Deaths**: Examining the high mortality rate in hospitals during Semmelweis's time.
3. **Death at the Clinics**: Analyzing mortality rates at two different clinics.
4. **The Handwashing Begins**: Exploring the implementation of handwashing as a hygiene practice.
5. **The Effect of Handwashing**: Investigating the impact of handwashing on mortality rates.
6. **The Effect of Handwashing Highlighted**: Emphasizing the significance of the handwashing findings.
7. **More Handwashing, Fewer Deaths?**: Continuing the analysis to determine if handwashing led to fewer deaths.
8. **A Bootstrap Analysis of Semmelweis Handwashing Data**: Employing statistical analysis techniques to validate the results.
9. **The Fate of Dr. Semmelweis**: Reflecting on the legacy and consequences of Dr. Semmelweis's discovery.
